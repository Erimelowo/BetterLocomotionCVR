# BetterLocomotion

A Melonloader mod to improve locomotion for ChilloutVR.

## Features

- **Fixes the inconvenience that happens when moving while looking up**, usually while laying down or cuddling, for example.
- **Hip locomotion.** Allows you move towards your hip tracker instead of your head to be able to look around while moving.
- **Improves Decamove support.** Makes the behaviour of decamove better.

## Settings descriptions

- **Locomotion mode**: which reference should be used for locomotion (head, hip or decamove)

## Dependency

- TODO
